We're Mario and Cata. We're from Medellín and your Colombian hosts. We're both software engineers, but more importantly, we're a couple passionate about living life to the fullest! We loved Airbnb when we first used it on a trip through South America, and now we love to host, just as we would want to be hosted ;) 

Through AirBnB, we've found a whole new way to experience the joys and learnings of travelling from our own city of Medellín- we love meeting and learning from new friends, cultures, languages and stories!
 
More than your hosts, we offer you our friendship. We love to help out with a smile. Hey, we are from Medellín after all, that's what we are known for :)

We love Medellín and we love our beautiful properties, which we take so much pride in keeping in tip top shape! We really enjoy sharing them with you, so you can have the best experience in this wonderful city.","Where I went to school: National University of Colombia","My work: Host & programmer

Vibrant Community: Laureles has a strong sense of community, where locals and expats mingle in a welcoming environment. The area exudes a laid-back vibe that attracts people seeking a balanced, slower pace of life.<br /><br /><br />2. Green Spaces: With its wide, tree-lined streets and parks, like Parque Primeros Laureles and Parque de los Olivos, Laureles offers an abundance of green spaces perfect for walking, relaxing, or exercising. This contributes to the area’s pleasant, refreshing atmosphere.<br /><br /><br />3. Cultural Scene: Laureles is home to a growing number of art galleries, live music venues, and cultural events. Its proximity to universities, such as Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana, adds an academic and creative energy to the area.<br /><br /><br />4. Walkability: Unlike many neighborhoods in big cities, Laureles is highly walkable. You can stroll around safely, with easy access to restaurants, cafés, bars, and shops without relying heavily on cars.<br /><br /><br />5. Great Food Scene: The neighborhood boasts a fantastic food scene, from traditional Colombian eateries to international cuisine. La 70 (a lively street known for its nightlife) and La 33 offer countless options, ranging from street food to gourmet dining.<br /><br /><br />6. Safety: Compared to other parts of Medellín, Laureles is considered safer, with a calm, residential feel. This makes it popular among families, professionals, and digital nomads.<br /><br /><br />7. Quality of Life: With a perfect blend of urban amenities, green spaces, cultural activities, and a laid-back vibe, Laureles offers a high quality of life. It's less chaotic than more touristy areas like El Poblado, yet still vibrant and full of character.<br /><br /><br />8. Affordable Living: While offering all these amenities, Laureles remains relatively affordable compared to similar neighborhoods in other global cities, making it a desirable spot for both locals and expats.<br /><br /><br /><br />These factors make Laureles a standout neighborhood for those seeking a balanced lifestyle that blends modern urban living with natural beauty and cultural richness.","152","Medellín, Antioquia, Colombia","Getting around in Laureles is easy for several key reasons:<br /><br />1. Walkability: Laureles is designed with pedestrians in mind, featuring wide, tree-lined streets that are flat and easy to navigate on foot. The blocks are well-connected, so you can easily walk to shops, restaurants, parks, and other amenities without needing a car.<br /><br /><br />2. Public Transport: The area is well-served by public transportation. There are bus routes running through major streets like La 33 and La 70, as well as nearby metro stations like Estadio and Suramericana, which connect to the rest of Medellín.<br /><br /><br />3. Cycling-Friendly: Medellín, including Laureles, has made a strong push toward being bike-friendly, with designated cycling lanes. The terrain is relatively flat in this area, making it a great option for getting around by bike.<br /><br /><br />4. Taxi and Rideshare Availability: Taxis and rideshare services like Uber are abundant in Laureles. You can easily call a car and get to nearby neighborhoods or other parts of Medellín quickly and affordably.<br /><br /><br />5. Strategic Location: Laureles is centrally located within Medellín, making it easy to access key parts of the city. It's close to both downtown Medellín and popular areas like El Poblado, without the heavy traffic and congestion of busier districts.<br /><br /><br />6. Clear Street Layout: The streets in Laureles follow a grid pattern, which makes navigating the neighborhood intuitive. This clear layout reduces confusion for drivers, pedestrians, and cyclists alike.<br /><br /><br /><br />These factors combine to create a neighborhood that is both accessible and convenient, making it easy to get around whether by foot, public transport, or private vehicle.","152","Getting around","Medellín, Antioquia, Colombia","Nov 11, 2024 - Entire rental unit for $142.

We also run an Ayahuasca healing centre just outside of Medellin where we work alongside indigenous Shaman to facilitate processes of deep healing and self-discovery with the help of the Amazonian plant medicines. We've had people from all over the world join us on retreats, and this is just the beginning ;) Our mission is to help change lives for the better, and to shed light upon the incredible nature of the world we live in, and the people who compose it.

mentioned earlier the area is pretty hard to beat, just 2 blocks from the charming and energetic ""la 70"" stretch of cafes, bars and restaurants, with the city's most prestigious university (la UPB) and Unicentro mall and movie theater just a short walk away as well. the city's main sports stadium is just down the road aswell, where you can get a taste of Colombian soccer or check out the olympic swimming pools or free outdoor gym. <br />- one of the nicest things about the area is the number or healthy/organic restaurants and cafes within walking distance, as the city has just recently started to pay attention to the demand for healthy alternatives and this part of town seems to be leading the way, there's some REALLY great restaurants just a block away :)...all of this while being just far enough away from the action so that the nights are quiet and the rooms remain peaceful, like I said...pretty hard to beat :)","0","Medellin, Antioquia, Colombia","This area is VERY central, a short taxi or metro ride to downtown, or any other part of town for that matter so it's one of the best location in terms of getting around medellin <br />- The Estadio Metro station is just a 10 minute walk up ""la 70"", and gives you access to Medellin's award winning metro system, where you can access any part of the city, safely and comfortably for less than $1 USD, to be honest traveling via metro is great in Medellin, and really gives you a taste of the city, so don't miss out <br />- taxis in Medellin are very inexpensive with a 10 minute taxi ride sometimes costing no more than $3.00 USD, which is obviously very cool","0","Getting around","Medellin, Antioquia, Colombia","Nov 11, 2024 - Entire loft for $100.

We're Mario and Cata. We're from Medellín and your Colombian hosts. We're both software engineers, but more importantly, we're a couple passionate about living life to the fullest! We loved Airbnb when we first used it on a trip through South America, and now we love to host, just as we would want to be hosted ;) 

Through AirBnB, we've found a whole new way to experience the joys and learnings of travelling from our own city of Medellín- we love meeting and learning from new friends, cultures, languages and stories!
 
More than your hosts, we offer you our friendship. We love to help out with a smile. Hey, we are from Medellín after all, that's what we are known for :)

We love Medellín and we love our beautiful properties, which we take so much pride in keeping in tip top shape! We really enjoy sharing them with you, so you can have the best experience in this wonderful city.","Where I went to school: National University of Colombia","My work: Host & programmer

There is a short distance to the Stadium Metro station, a system that connects much of the city for a low cost. No matter the time and where you are in Medellin, you will have great availability of vehicles using apps such as Uber or taxis that will be willing to take you to our apartment as a safe place not only for visitors but also for those who work on these types of platforms and provide transportation services.","152","Medellín, Antioquia, Colombia","This is the great highlight of our location. Being flat topography, lovers of walking cities can enjoy this area on foot. This does not imply that transportation in the area is poor, on the contrary, there is ease of rental of bicycles, with the largest route network in the city located in the sector. Public transportation is also very complete, from bus lines, taxis, and the Metro system at a short distance.<br /><br />CAR PARK:<br /><br />- The apartment does not have a parking space or this service included in the price of the stay.<br />- You could have additional costs to park depending on where you decide to park.<br />- Use of this service and the option selected by the guest is at your own risk. Since this service is not included in the apartment, we are not responsible for the care of vehicles.<br />- When looking for this service, we recommend comparing prices and location so that you decide on the option that best suits your preferences.<br />- We recommend never leaving valuables inside vehicles, regardless of where you decide to park. Never leave computers, money, documents, bags, etc. inside the vehicle when you leave it. It's best not to give criminal a chance.<br /><br />Here are the parking alternatives you can find in the area:<br /><br />* On 72nd Street, on the corner next to the apartment. (24 hours) During the day you are likely to meet a gentleman asking for any cooperation for the care of the vehicle. At night the vehicle would be unguarded.<br /><br />* Public parking lots for payment. (Closing times). Several of these spaces can be found in the area. Here are some suggestions because of proximity:<br />- Parqueadero Mutiservicios San Juan: Carrera 70A #43 - 2. A 2-minute walk.<br />- Parqueadero Atanasio Girardot: (Hours 5am - 11pm) Carrera 73 #44A - 02. A 2-minute walk. <br />- Parqueadero Elberautos (70 Autos): Calle 43 #70A - 60- A 2-minute walk away.<br />- Parking La 73: Cra. 73 #45d - 17. A 4-minute walk.<br /><br />It is important to clarify that we do not have any relationship with these parking lots, so we are not responsible for the service they provide.

We're Mario and Cata. We're from Medellín and your Colombian hosts. We're both software engineers, but more importantly, we're a couple passionate about living life to the fullest! We loved Airbnb when we first used it on a trip through South America, and now we love to host, just as we would want to be hosted ;) 

Through AirBnB, we've found a whole new way to experience the joys and learnings of travelling from our own city of Medellín- we love meeting and learning from new friends, cultures, languages and stories!

Easy to walk around, and has everything you need within reach. Laureles is one of the most recognized neighborhoods in Medellín, with a great quality of life that has been maintained for decades thanks to its planned development and the balance between natural spaces (abundant parks and trees), and the opportunity of experiencing the best of Medellin’s authenticity. <br /><br />The history of Laureles begins around 1940, thanks to Pedro Nel Ospina, who designed the layout of the neighborhood with circular streets around the nascent Pontifical Bolivarian University, which, for a long time, was the main axis of the sector. It was conceived under the “Garden City” model; a housing concept designed to favor the raising of children, in which trees, green areas and circular streets allow the integration of the community.<br /><br />The Laureles neighborhood is located in the central western area of Medellín, within commune 11, Laureles-Stadium. The architectural landscape maintains a residential and exclusive air, typical of garden cities. Currently, a new commercial attraction has emerged that highlights the sector as a trendier and more modern area where restaurants, hotels, clothing boutiques and art galleries have great prominence. It has 3 spaces of green areas ideal for family recreation, among these the First Park of Laureles and the Second Park of Laureles stand out. The sector as a whole promotes environmentally friendly mobility, for this reason it is considered the best area of Medellín for bicycling and walking.<br /><br />There are shopping centers (UniCentro and Viva Laureles), several supermarkets (Carulla, El Éxito, D1, Euro, Plaza Mercado de la America), fast food chains, luxury restaurants, gyms, cafes, banks, clubs and bars. All within less than a 10 minutes walk from the property.","0","Medellín, Antioquia, Colombia","1. There is a taxi station on the park next to the building, right across the street.<br />2.

Easy to walk around, and has everything you need within reach. Laureles is one of the most recognized neighborhoods in Medellín, with a great quality of life that has been maintained for decades thanks to its planned development and the balance between natural spaces (abundant parks and trees), and the opportunity of experiencing the best of Medellin’s authenticity. <br /><br />The history of Laureles begins around 1940, thanks to Pedro Nel Ospina, who designed the layout of the neighborhood with circular streets around the nascent Pontifical Bolivarian University, which, for a long time, was the main axis of the sector. It was conceived under the “Garden City” model; a housing concept designed to favor the raising of children, in which trees, green areas and circular streets allow the integration of the community.<br /><br />The Laureles neighborhood is located in the central western area of Medellín, within commune 11, Laureles-Stadium. The architectural landscape maintains a residential and exclusive air, typical of garden cities. Currently, a new commercial attraction has emerged that highlights the sector as a trendier and more modern area where restaurants, hotels, clothing boutiques and art galleries have great prominence. It has 3 spaces of green areas ideal for family recreation, among these the First Park of Laureles and the Second Park of Laureles stand out. The sector as a whole promotes environmentally friendly mobility, for this reason it is considered the best area of Medellín for bicycling and walking.<br /><br />There are shopping centers (UniCentro and Viva Laureles), several supermarkets (Carulla, El Éxito, D1, Euro, Plaza Mercado de la America), fast food chains, luxury restaurants, gyms, cafes, banks, clubs and bars. All within less than a 10 minutes walk from the property.","0","Medellín, Antioquia, Colombia","1. There is a taxi station on the park next to the building, right across the street.<br />2.

We're Mario and Cata. We're from Medellín and your Colombian hosts. We're both software engineers, but more importantly, we're a couple passionate about living life to the fullest! We loved Airbnb when we first used it on a trip through South America, and now we love to host, just as we would want to be hosted ;) 

Through AirBnB, we've found a whole new way to experience the joys and learnings of travelling from our own city of Medellín- we love meeting and learning from new friends, cultures, languages and stories!
 
More than your hosts, we offer you our friendship. We love to help out with a smile. Hey, we are from Medellín after all, that's what we are known for :)

We love Medellín and we love our beautiful properties, which we take so much pride in keeping in tip top shape! We really enjoy sharing them with you, so you can have the best experience in this wonderful city.","Born in the 80s","My work: Host & programmer :)",,,,"Response rate: 100%","Responds within an

Just provide us your pick-up location and we can quote it for you.<br />All prices are set by our driver, we don't take a commission or anything. We started working with a trusted driver as we saw the inconveniences guests had with Ubers. It's very important to us our guests arrive safe and effortless! We're doing this to help our guests and locals.<br /><br /><br />-----------------------MAX. Check-in 6PM---------------------------------<br />For your own well-being and safety, we cannot receive you after 6PM. As we're located in a rural area with very little street lighthing, it will become very difficult to recognize the reference points to get to our cabin. Some parts of the road are also unpaved and might make your trip more difficult at night. Reception is neither very good in the rural areas of Medellín/Santa Elena so it would be even harder for us to assist you in case you can't find the way.<br />During the day we don't experience these inconveniences so we therefore kindly ask for your understanding regarding our check-in time!<br /><br /><b>Registration number</b><br />122682","6","628999566771077619","Listing image

We're Mario and Cata. We're from Medellín and your Colombian hosts. We're both software engineers, but more importantly, we're a couple passionate about living life to the fullest! We loved Airbnb when we first used it on a trip through South America, and now we love to host, just as we would want to be hosted ;) 

Through AirBnB, we've found a whole new way to experience the joys and learnings of travelling from our own city of Medellín- we love meeting and learning from new friends, cultures, languages and stories!
 
More than your hosts, we offer you our friendship. We love to help out with a smile. Hey, we are from Medellín after all, that's what we are known for :)

We love Medellín and we love our beautiful properties, which we take so much pride in keeping in tip top shape! We really enjoy sharing them with you, so you can have the best experience in this wonderful city.","Where I went to school: National University of Colombia","My work: Host & programmer

We're Mario and Cata. We're from Medellín and your Colombian hosts. We're both software engineers, but more importantly, we're a couple passionate about living life to the fullest! We loved Airbnb when we first used it on a trip through South America, and now we love to host, just as we would want to be hosted ;) 

Through AirBnB, we've found a whole new way to experience the joys and learnings of travelling from our own city of Medellín- we love meeting and learning from new friends, cultures, languages and stories!
 
More than your hosts, we offer you our friendship. We love to help out with a smile. Hey, we are from Medellín after all, that's what we are known for :)

We love Medellín and we love our beautiful properties, which we take so much pride in keeping in tip top shape! We really enjoy sharing them with you, so you can have the best experience in this wonderful city.","Born in the 80s","My work: Host & programmer :)",,,,"Response rate: 100%","Responds within an

We're Mario and Cata. We're from Medellín and your Colombian hosts. We're both software engineers, but more importantly, we're a couple passionate about living life to the fullest! We loved Airbnb when we first used it on a trip through South America, and now we love to host, just as we would want to be hosted ;) 

Through AirBnB, we've found a whole new way to experience the joys and learnings of travelling from our own city of Medellín- we love meeting and learning from new friends, cultures, languages and stories!
 
More than your hosts, we offer you our friendship. We love to help out with a smile. Hey, we are from Medellín after all, that's what we are known for :)

We love Medellín and we love our beautiful properties, which we take so much pride in keeping in tip top shape! We really enjoy sharing them with you, so you can have the best experience in this wonderful city.","My work: Host & programmer :)","Most useless skill: I can move my ears, not many can do that",,,,"Response rate: 100%","Responds within an hour","RGVtYW5kVXNlcjoxODgzODA4NA==","true","true","Mario","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/a8eef93f-71a1-4d05-9609-97bf07c87189.jpg","4.76","17430","1","8",,"Checking in and out","SYSTEM_CLOCK","Check-in after 3:00 PM","SYSTEM_CLOCK","Checkout before 11:00 AM","SYSTEM_CHECK_IN","Self check-in with building staff","During your stay","SYSTEM_FAMILY","2 guests maximum","SYSTEM_PETS","Pets allowed","SYSTEM_NO_EVENTS","No parties or events","SYSTEM_SMOKING_ALLOWED","Smoking is allowed","SYSTEM_CLIPBOARD","Additional rules",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"• Strictly cleaned and sanitized<br />• Wide open spaces, loads of green around<br />• Amazing location in the heart of Poblado: ""Oasis in the middle of the best part of Poblado, just far away enough from the noise, but walking distance to the heart""<br />• Air Conditioning<br />• Pool + Hot tub in common areas<br />• High speed 100 Mb WiFi<br />• Private outdoor patio<br />• Extremely safe neighborhood<br />• Modern, comfortable fully furnished Loft<br />• Fully equipped kitchen<br />• 43"" Smart TV with Netflix + Cable TV<br />• Free Parking<br /><br /><b>The space</b><br />• Escape from the concrete jungle.

We're Mario and Cata. We're from Medellín and your Colombian hosts. We're both software engineers, but more importantly, we're a couple passionate about living life to the fullest! We loved Airbnb when we first used it on a trip through South America, and now we love to host, just as we would want to be hosted ;) 

Through AirBnB, we've found a whole new way to experience the joys and learnings of travelling from our own city of Medellín- we love meeting and learning from new friends, cultures, languages and stories!
 
More than your hosts, we offer you our friendship. We love to help out with a smile. Hey, we are from Medellín after all, that's what we are known for :)

We love Medellín and we love our beautiful properties, which we take so much pride in keeping in tip top shape! We really enjoy sharing them with you, so you can have the best experience in this wonderful city.","Where I went to school: National University of Colombia","My work: Host & programmer

Identify your starting point: Make sure you know where you're starting your trip from. It may be helpful to use apps to get accurate directions in real time.<br /><br />2. Use the public transport system. To get to the Bicentenario station, you must arrive at a metro station and then combine with the tram.<br /><br />3. Take the subway: If you're not close to a subway station, head to the nearest one. The Medellin subway has several lines. If you're on Line A (blue), be sure to head towards the north direction.<br /><br />4. Transhipment to Tram: Once at a San Antonio subway station, look for directions or ask the station staff how to transfer to the Bicentennial Tram. Exit the metro station and follow the signs in the area to get to the station and take the tram.<br /><br />5. Arrival at the accommodation: when you arrive at the Bicentennial of the tram station (4th stop), exit the station and head northwest on Av. Ayacucho/Cl. 49 towards Cra. 38. Turn left with direction to Cra. 38 and walk 50m. You'll find your destination right at the Aiana Verde building.<br /><br />6. Access to the accommodation: enter the building by the concierge and record your information with the security guard, indicating that you will be staying in apartment 402. Take the left tower elevator up to the 4th floor and locate the bottom of the hallway. Tap the digital lock board until the keypad is activated, enter the passcode sent by the host followed by the # key, and that's it... <br /><br />Enjoy your time!!<br /><br />Remember to check updated times and routes before starting your trip as there may be changes due to maintenance or other circumstances.","0","Getting around","Medellín, Antioquia, Colombia","Nov 11, 2024 - Entire loft for $35.

We're Mario and Cata. We're from Medellín and your Colombian hosts. We're both software engineers, but more importantly, we're a couple passionate about living life to the fullest! We loved Airbnb when we first used it on a trip through South America, and now we love to host, just as we would want to be hosted ;) 

Through AirBnB, we've found a whole new way to experience the joys and learnings of travelling from our own city of Medellín- we love meeting and learning from new friends, cultures, languages and stories!
 
More than your hosts, we offer you our friendship. We love to help out with a smile. Hey, we are from Medellín after all, that's what we are known for :)

We love Medellín and we love our beautiful properties, which we take so much pride in keeping in tip top shape! We really enjoy sharing them with you, so you can have the best experience in this wonderful city.","Born in the 80s","My work: Host & programmer :)",,,,"Response rate: 100%","Responds within an hour","RGVtYW5kVXNlcjoxODgzODA4NA==","true","true","Mario","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/a8eef93f-71a1-4d05-9609-97bf07c87189.jpg","4.76","17430","1","8",,"Checking in and out","SYSTEM_CLOCK","Check-in after 3:00 PM","SYSTEM_CLOCK","Checkout before 11:00 AM","SYSTEM_CHECK_IN","Self check-in with building staff","During your stay","SYSTEM_FAMILY","2 guests maximum","SYSTEM_PETS","Pets allowed","SYSTEM_EVENING","Quiet hours","SYSTEM_NO_EVENTS","No parties or events",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"• Amazing location in heart of Poblado: ""Oasis in the middle of the best part of the city, walking distance to everything”<br />• High speed 200 Mb WiFi<br />• Loads of nature around<br />• A/C<br />• Pool, Jacuzzis & outdoor furniture in  common areas<br />• 5 mins walk to best restaurants, cafes, malls. 22 mins walk to Poblado and Lleras Park<br />• Fully stocked kitchen<br />• 43"" Smart TV<br />• Transparent prices: No guest fee, no service or cleaning fee<br />• On site 24/7 staff<br />• Luggage storage<br />• Washer & dryer (paid, self-service)<br /><br /><b>The space</b><br />This is a big property with multiple Lofts (small, independent apartments).
