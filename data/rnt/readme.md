## Remarks ## 

Unfortunately, it was not possible to calculate the number of VILLAS TURISTICAS by subcategory in each commune due to the lack of location information (such as the neighborhood at least).

However, this is a very important variable to attract digital nomads who have a longer stay than leisure or conventional work tourists and are interested in renting furnished properties.

According to [airbtics](https://app.airbtics.com/airbnb-data/columbia/0/medellin,%20antioquia,%20colombia) there are **18,882** unit available in Medellin to rent through AirBNB

We also tried using [Airbnb Scraper](https://apify.com/onidivo/airbnb-scraper) to extract Airbnb listing information, but the address information provided is difficult to transform into geolocation.
